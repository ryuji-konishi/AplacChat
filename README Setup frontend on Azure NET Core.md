# Setup Front-End on Azure .NET Core
This document describes how to setup and run the APLaC Chat front-end web page. This web page accepts the text that the user types in, sends the text to the Chat component and shows the result.

## Setup Environment (MacOS X + .NET Core + Azure)
The front-end web page is develped with .NET Core and MacOS X is used as the development machine. And finally it will be deployed on Microsoft Azure.

### Things required in advance
* .NET Core 2.0 SDK for Mac
* Visual Studio Code for Mac


## Development Notes
This section keeps the record of key notes, references and other important points that are found during the development.

### .NET Core Project Generation and Configuration
The original project structure is generated by .NET SDK as Razor Pages Project.
```
dotnet new razor -o frontend
```
Add the bundler minifier NuGet package which is required to generate .min.css and .min.js files. Otherwise those files won't be updated when you build the project.
```
dotnet add package BuildBundlerMinifier
```
To set the build mode (Release/Debug), set an environment variable below but this is only eligible when you run the project with ```dotnet run``` command.
```
export ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT=Development
```
Note when you debug the code with Visual Studio Code, the build mode is automatically set to 'Development'.
