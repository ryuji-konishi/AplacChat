# Front-End Component

## aplac-chat.koni4.net
This folder contains the web site files that are statically placed on the web hosting server.
This is done because of hosting cost, web hosting services that are available for ASP.NET are slightly more expensive than the plain old (Linux + CGI) services.
The files in this folder are generated locally by saving files with web browser while showing the local running frontend web page with dotnet run command.

## Files
